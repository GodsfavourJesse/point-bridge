                Welcome to <span className="font-medium text-blue-600">Point Bridge</span>, a rewarding platform where your attention and engagement turn into real value.
                <br /><br />
                Our system is powered by verified advertisement partners like <span className="font-semibold">Google AdSense</span> and other affiliate networks. When you watch sponsored content, complete tasks, or engage with partner campaigns, you earn points that can be redeemed for rewards.
                <br /><br />
                We offer daily, weekly, and surprise task challenges, designed to be quick and enjoyable â€” from clicking ads, sharing links, to exploring product demos. Each action supports our advertisers and helps you earn more.
                <br /><br />
                All points earned are recorded instantly in your wallet. Once you reach the minimum threshold, you can redeem your points for airtime, gift cards, digital products, or even cash.
                <br /><br />
                Our community values fairness, transparency, and consistency. We encourage you to explore, participate, and grow with us â€” the more active you are, the more you earn.
                <br /><br />
